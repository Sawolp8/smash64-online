Download GitHub Obtain the Smash64 ROM \u00b6 You must legally obtain your own ROM. This site does not endorse or condone piracy. Do not ask how to obtain a ROM in Discord. Configure your ROM Directory \u00b6 Open Project64KSE.exe and select your ROM directory (where your ROM is located). Select your Plugins \u00b6 Plugins are selected in Options -> Settings -> Plugins . You can configure each plugin through Options -> Configure Plugin . Graphics \u00b6 GLideN64 Public Release 2.0 Recommended OpenGL \u00b6 Correctly renders most things in-game and does not crash the emulator when ending emulation. GLideN64 Public Release 4.0 OpenGL \u00b6 The most accurate and best looking plugin, but usually crashes the emulator when ending emulation. Jabo\u2019s Direct3D8 1.6 DirectX \u00b6 Older plugin that uses less resources than GLideN64, but has visual glitches (does not show invincibility). Only use if you can\u2019t run GLideN64 or OpenGL. Audio \u00b6 Azimer's Audio v0.30 (Old Driver) Recommended \u00b6 Standard audio plugin. Other audio plugins may cause desyncs. It is recommended to reduce Buffer Size to the 2nd tick (see image) so game audio is less delayed. This is not saved and must be done every time the game is launched. No Sound \u00b6 Simple audio plugin that disables sound entirely. Does not seem to cause desyncs. Configure your Controller \u00b6 N64 / Hori (N64 compatible controllers) GameCube Keyboard Xbox / Other USB If your controller can plug into an N64, you'll want a Raphnet N64 to USB adapter . Select the raphnetraw 1 player NET version controller plugin. No configuration required! If you have any other N64 to USB adapter, you'll need to select an N-Rage input plugin and configure your bindings manually. If you have a GameCube to USB adapter, follow the instructions on the GameCube Controller Configuration page. If you have a GameCube to N64 adapter for console play, you can connect it to an N64 to USB adapter for maximum accuracy and follow the N64 Compatible Controllers instructions above. To use keyboard, first choose N-Rage's Direct-Input8 1.61 as your input plugin. Then go to Configure Controller Plugin: Check Raw Data. If you skip this step, Netplay will not work! Press Assign Keys. In the top right, choose \"Keyboard\". Bind your keys according to preference and choose Apply. If you're using Windows 7, select N-Rage as your controller plugin, then choose Configure Controller Plugin and set your bindings as you like. Ensure RawData is checked under controller pak settings If you're using Windows 8 or newer, you may need to download a premade N-Rage config file. See the Xbox Controller Configuration page for details. Start Netplay \u00b6 Ethernet Highly Recommended Use a wired Ethernet connection when playing netplay. WiFi connections are inherently unreliable and will frustrate you and your opponents. Launch Netplay with File -> Start Netplay . Use the Change Mode dropdown to select between Server or P2P (Peer to Peer). Peer to peer connections are more stable, but require one player to port forward in order to host. Higher ping causes higher frame delay. Most players play on 3 frames or less. You must restart the emulator if another player is joining or any player changes port. Servers may sometimes go down and active servers may be found on the master server list. Connecting via Server Connecting via P2P Start Netplay. Server mode is the default. Select the server to join. A full list of servers can be found by clicking Master Servers List . Host or join lobbies to play Host starts game Up to 4 players can play in server matches. Start Netplay. Click the Change Mode dropdown and select 1. P2P . Host must have ports forwarded and provide external IP to other player Host selects the game and clicks Host . Client chooses the Connect tab, enters the Host's IP in the Peer IP box, and connects. Both players tick Ready to start the game Only 2 players can play P2P. Frequently Asked Questions \u00b6 My game runs fine, but the audio is delayed. \u00b6 Follow the instructions in the Azimer's section above. Yes, it's annoying to set the Buffer Size every time, unfortunately this is hard to fix. My game feels laggy. Is there any way to reduce input delay? \u00b6 The first step is to launch the game from the main menu and check whether you're experiencing the input delay during local (non-netplay) games, or only when playing online. If you're experiencing delay locally, try playing in full screen mode, as new version of Windows apply forced vsync to windowed applications which sometimes causes issues. You can use Alt+Enter to go fullscreen, or go to Options -> Settings -> Options and enable \"On loading a ROM go to full screen\". If you're using Glide as your graphics plugin (recommended), ensure Frame Buffer emulation is disabled but opening Options -> Configure Graphics Plugin -> Frame Buffer and make sure Emulate Frame Buffer is unchecked . If you only experience delay when playing online, there are a variety of options for improving your network connection. Make sure to play on ethernet, not wifi. If possible, play using P2P rather than server, or look for a server close to you using the server list. When hosting P2P, you can try entering a higher delay in the Enter custom frame delay box. For example, if the connection is jittery on 1 frame, try forcing a 2 frame delay. The same effect can be replicated on server by spoofing a higher ping. If you frequently experience lag, you may want to investigate your network for bufferbloat . I'm trying to configure a USB controller, but when I press a button, nothing happens. \u00b6 This is an issue with N-Rage on newer version of Windows. See the Xbox Setup Instructions for more information. My question isn't here. \u00b6 If you are still having problems with netplay, ask in #help in the Smash 64 Discord .
